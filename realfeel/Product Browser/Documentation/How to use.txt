When you start this program, it may be a little confusing as to how it works, so I'll explain:
When this application starts, it reads a config.ini file that should be located in the same area where the application is found.
If the config.ini doesn't exist, the application will offer to make a new copy; it can even write information for the Dual Solace Downloads Directory.
Once the config.ini file is set up, it will then attempt to download a new copy of the directory (to make sure it is up-to-date).
If it can't, it will still offer the ability to use an older directory file (with the same name of course).

Now to explain how each INI file works.

The configuration file below is an example of what one may look like:
---------------------------------------------------------
-Configuration file for Dual Solace Product Browser-
-Created by smchronos-

-Size Limit for downloads-
Size_Limit:51200

-Root website for directory file-
Directory_Root:www.dualsolace.com/Downloads/

-Name of directory file-
Directory_Extension:Dual_Solace_Downloads_Directory.ini
---------------------------------------------------------

The <Size_Limit> is a setting that determines how large of a file you want to be able to download.
*It isn't the most useful setting, but it can prevent you from starting a download that you do not plan to finish.
*This setting is measured in kilobytes, so 51200 KB is 50 MB.
*This can be adjusted not only in the text file, but also in the program itself by going to Options --> Download Limit
The <Directory_Root> defines the folder of a website where the directory file will be found. Make sure to include a / at the end of the folder name.
The <Directory_Extension> defines the name of the directory file to download and what will be used in case a new copy can't be downloaded.


The directory file below is an example of what one may look like:
---------------------------------------------------------
File_Name:RealFeel 1.1.1
File_Description:A nice, friendly file.
File_Address:www.dualsolace.com/Downloads/RealFeel111.zip
file_description:Another nice file.
File_name:RealFeel 1.1.2
File_address:www.dualsolace.com/Downloads/RealFeel112.zip
---------------------------------------------------------

As you can see, the directory file only needs to contain three pieces of information to function:
A <File_Name> key, which specifies what the application will call the file.
A <File_Description> key, which specifies the description that the application will display about the file.
A <File_Address> key, which points to the actual file to download.

The order of the keys is only sensitive in that the keys are read in order. The first <File_Name> pairs with the first <File_Description> and <File_Address>.
So, make sure your keys are in a similar pattern.

For example:
---------------------------------------------------------
File_Name:RealFeel 1.1.1
File_Description:A nice, friendly file.
File_Address:www.dualsolace.com/Downloads/RealFeel111.zip

File_Name:RealFeel 1.1.2
File_Description:Another nice file.
File_Address:www.dualsolace.com/Downloads/RealFeel112.zip
---------------------------------------------------------

OR:
---------------------------------------------------------
File_Address:www.dualsolace.com/Downloads/RealFeel111.zip
File_Name:RealFeel 1.1.1
File_Description:A nice, friendly file.

File_Address:www.dualsolace.com/Downloads/RealFeel112.zip
File_Name:RealFeel 1.1.2
File_Description:Another nice file.
---------------------------------------------------------

OR:
---------------------------------------------------------
File_Name:RealFeel 1.1.1
File_Name:RealFeel 1.1.2

File_Description:A nice, friendly file.
File_Description:Another nice file.

File_Address:www.dualsolace.com/Downloads/RealFeel111.zip
File_Address:www.dualsolace.com/Downloads/RealFeel112.zip
---------------------------------------------------------

I hope all of you find this program to be quite useful!
