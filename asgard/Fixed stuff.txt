Fixed stuff by Lil N00b

Client side

-When registering a user it goes form the Desired account username line to the confirm password not the account password, so it skips a line if you press tab.

-no minimise button to minimise game screen.

-The text box and the game screen run off the screen just a little bit.


Server Side

-When you minimise the server to the tray you cannot bring it back up. It just stays their.

-MAX_CONDITIONS bug fixed.

-The .curcondition bug fixed. (Thanks to Rafiki)

-Fixed SPELL_TYPE_GIVEITEM (Thanks to Rafiki)

-Fixed the error that gives you an error thinking that I can connect to the mySQL database but asgard dosnt work off mySQL yet :P

-[Now you can compile the Server to make the .EXE] <- not a bug but im telling you that you can at least compile the server.
