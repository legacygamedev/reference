Well, here it is, the source code to my Asgard Engine... Although it may not look
too special yet, many hours of work went into this code and many more will follow.

The biggest change is that now others can help with it. I hope they will.

If you decide not to help but make your own engine with it, I can't stop you nor do
I want to. But if you want to help me improve it, do that.

At the time of writing, the websites you can go to to get support with this code are:

	- www.elysiumsource.com
	- www.asgard-engine.net.ms

If you want to know more or have any questions or feedback, contact me on either
of this sites or via mail at atlantisbase@gmail.com

And now... Have fun!



Greetz, Atlantis
