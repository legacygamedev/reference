First off make sure you have SadScript3:
http://www.pscode.com/vb/scripts/ShowZip.asp?lngWId=1&lngCodeId=36716&strZipAccessCode=tp%2FS367166177

Ok in the zip folder you should see DLL and Sample.
From the DLL folder copy the clsRC4 and clsSadScript put that into your game's server folder.
Now go into the Sample folder.
Copy clsCommands and put that into your game's server folder.
Good now open up your game's server project.
Now add all 3 of those Class Modules to your project.
Go to Project>Reference and make reference to: Mircrosoft Script Control 1.0
Now open clsSadScript and change:
Code:
Public Type define
    sVari As String
    sValue As String
End Type

to
Code:
Private Type define
    sVari As String
    sValue As String
End Type

Now find:
Sub InitServer()
Add this near the top:
Code:
Call SetStatus("Loading scripts...")
        Set MyScript = New clsSadScript
        Set clsScriptCommands = New clsCommands
        MyScript.ReadInCode App.Path & "\ScriptFile.txt", "\ScriptFile.txt", MyScript.SControl, False
        MyScript.SControl.AddObject "ScriptHardCode", clsScriptCommands, True

Note: You can change \ScriptFile.txt to whatever you want, just make sure you know this name for later.

Now add this anywhere you want the script to load:
Code:
MyScript.ExecuteStatement "ScriptFile.txt", "SubNameHere"

Now change SubNameHere to whatever sub you want it to load.
Ok now if you want variables like player index do this:
Code:
MyScript.ExecuteStatement "ScriptFile.txt", "SubNameHere " & index

Note the space after the SubNameHere, you will always need that.
Now if you want more variables do:
Code:
MyScript.ExecuteStatement "ScriptFile.txt", "SubNameHere " & index & "," & index

And so on!

I almost forgot! Add this in any module at the top:
Code:
Option Explicit
Global MyScript As clsSadScript
Public clsScriptCommands As clsCommands

That should be it!

If you got any questions just ask!

Oh yeah another thing xD For some reason SadScript doesnt support sending strings to there subs, so you can only send numbers! What I mean by that is you CANT do:
Code:
MyScript.ExecuteStatement "ScriptFile.txt", "SubNameHere " & "Hello"
