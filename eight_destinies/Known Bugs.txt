If you have a weapon equipped it gets unequipped when you close the client.

Duration on items are not properly updated in item info until you leave a map.(Client).

Even if you have 0 SP you can still see arrows if you're shooting with a bow.

Upon Deposit/Withdraw in the bank, item durability is set to max.

Arrows can sometimes go through blocked tiles.
