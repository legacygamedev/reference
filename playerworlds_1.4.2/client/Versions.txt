11/6/03 v1.3
001 FIXED several bugs, minor and Major including /ban .
002 CHANGED max item pic in item editor from 255 to 1000
003 CHANGED max npc pic in npc editor from 255 to 1000
004 CHANGED format in banned.txt. It now displays in the following format :
********************************************************************************
account name/character name -- Banned by Admin name
Hard Drive Serial information
*.*.*.* (full IP address)
********************************************************************************
This new format is to provide for better management until I swap over to a database.
005 CHANGED Logs (admin and player) now display date and time of each event logged instead of time only (very useful for those of you that keep backlogs )
006 ADDED screenshots now have an option of file save formats (.bmp .gif .jpg .png)
007 CHANGED spell GFX have been causing the screen to freeze when blitting out the animations giving the appearance of temporary 'lag'.
         This is completely client-side and I have added the option for server owners to globally turn off and on the spell animations. I have also set the client so that 
          If there are no spell GFX included in the client's GFX folder, then creating spell animations will not be possible.
         I will NOT be providing the spell GFX commands or the basic spell GFX files in the general release. I *MIGHT* distribute them if there is a high enough demand, however.
008 ADDED Ignore List now fully functional

	          PM window and sets the "send to" to that player, making it                                 easier to PM a player by finding their name in the list and 
                                 double-clicking it.

044 ADDED	Logs now log date as well as time
045 CHANGED	Global Chat channel --- can now be turned off and on with the commands "/global off" and "/global on" (default is currently set to off). When global chat is turned off, lvl3+ admins can give any player a "global voice" as well as take it away.
046 ADDED	 Spell animations. They are currently using 2 GFX files to animatem 1 in full color and 1 as an inverted monochrome .bmp. This will need EXTENSIVE testing and will be released on Jerrath only until I perfect the system, so that I can release it with as few bugs as possible. If it proves to be a problem then I will have to further refine the code before releasing this feature to the general public.

****Explanation of guild/clan system****

1. It starts by a level 3+ admin typing "/setguild" and filling in the proper fields. This will create a guild owner, guild access level 4 (the person selected)
2. In order for a member to join a clan/guild, a guild guardian (lvl2 Guild access) must show support for that player (train them for the guild) by typing "/support <playername>". At this point the player is not a "full member" of the guild, only a trainee.
3. Once support is shown (i suggest that all "trainees go through a short period of training, about a week or two to make it worthwhile) a guild Leader (guild access lvl 3) must type "/induct <playername". This will make the player a full member of the guild ( Guild access level 1).
4. any promotions can be done by a guild leader or a guild owner by using the command "/guildaccess <1-4> <playername>"
5. additional commands are as follows :
	"/disgrace <playername>" kicks a player out of the guild/clan
	"/quitguild" allows a player to quit a guild/clan
	"@ <message>" sends a message to all members of that players 	       guild/clan
That should cover it all. I plan to add more functionality at a later date.

11/02/2002 - Player Worlds 1.0cx3 (Experimental)

Fixes/Additions:

001. NOTE.     To avoid any mysterious auto-kicks of clients, all players SHOULD

002. FIXED.    (?) booting players when saving all players.
003. FIXED.    Banlist "blank line" bug.

               by whom the ban was placed.
005. ADDED.    /delban <FKey> command. Input the fkey of the ban you wish to lift.
               This will only work with mapper access level and above.
006. ADDED.    A little bit of security with playermove packet (grr).
007. ADDED.    Scripting framework. There is now a scripts subdirectory. It contains two
               files. Main.as, and Commands.as. Currently, the 2nd file is not being used.
               Follow the instructions in the Main.as file, under the Init sub. Any 
               questions? Ask on the forums.
008. ADDED.    Client automatically saves last password, encrypted.
009. ADDED.    Ability to shutdown server. Type in /shutdown. Server Owners only.
010. ADDED.    Ability to auto ban on all hacking attempts (use carefully).
011. ADDED.    Ability for server owners to reboot the server. Type in
               /reboot. Server Owners only.

               banlist.txt file.
015. CHANGED.  The client version will only be shown in the credits window, while the 
               server name will be shown in the title bar and above the GUI flood bars.
016. CHANGED.  /ban <player> <reason> . Now, when you ban a player, you can 
               optionally specify a reason (up to 255 characters).
017. CHANGED.  Encryption to a true Session Encryption Wheel. Expect future changes as needed.

10/25/2002 - Player Worlds 1.0cx2 (Experimental)

Fixes/Additions:

001. NOTE.     This is trial basis fixing, report!
002. FIXED.    Server side classes reloading... can't do that now.
003. FIXED.    GFX error message. It now reads properly.
004. FIXED.    If music scroll bar on map property is over the last actual midi file
               number, the scroll bar will revert to last number.
005. ADDED.    ServerName variable is added to the server's Data.ini file. You will
               need to replace the current name with the name of your server. This 
               will show up on the caption of the client's window, once connected.
006. ADDED.    On the client side Data.ini.... Added two variables. Maximize, and 
               Music. If music is set to 1, it will initialize the music engine 
               and play any music the map has, if it has one. Set to 0 if you do
               not want the music engine to be initialized. The Maximize variable
               set to 1, will have the main menu start out as maximized, filling
               your whole screen. If set to 0, it will be in normal size, centered
               on your screen.
007. ADDED.    Now supports up to 65,000 classes (overkill)
008. ADDED.    Class numerical variables now support up to 65,000. (This might

010. CHANGED.  Map morals have been changed. 2 new ones added, thanks to Dannicus!
               Savage Land(Yellow Color): Similar to the None moral, 
               only this time there are lesser death penalties. You can kill others 
               but they will only drop 1/4 of your gold and a random item.
               Arena(Grey Color): This allows people to PK without being considerred 
               one. In this moral, there is no exp loss nor coins/items dropped.
               In otherwords, there are no dying penalties.



10/21/2002 - Player Worlds 1.0cx1 (Experimental)

Fixes/Additions:

001. FIXED.    Invisible Player Bug. Depending on the settings of your MaxPlayers and 
               MaxMaps in the server's Data.ini, will determine if this bug will happen.
002. FIXED.    Client crashing when there is no such midi file in directory.
003. ADDED.    Data.INI file for Server. All of the variables can be changed whenever you 
               like, however, they will not take effect until you restart the computer.
               You can choose your port number you wish. Remember that the data.ini for
               the client will need to have the new port number in there, in order to 
               connect to your server. MaxMaps and MaxPlayers are two variables you will 
               need to fiddle with, to get the optimal settings for your server, based on
               your hardware.
004. ADDED.    Port variable for client side Data.ini. Make sure this is set to the port
               of the server you wish to connect to.



10/19/2002 - Player Worlds 1.0b

Fixes/Additions:

001. FIXED.    Music bug. When switching maps, if both maps have the same song, the song
               will not restart. If new map has no music, the song will end. If new map
               has a different song, then the new song will be played. Each song will
               loop 999 times which should be enough for any server.
002. ADDED.    Server cosmetic changes. (GUI, Messages)
003. ADDED.    Proper Installation setup
