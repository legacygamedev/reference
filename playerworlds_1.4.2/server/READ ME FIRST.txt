You can import all of your .ini files (except for MOTD.ini) into this folder.
All of the other files (accoun .ini files, Main.as, and map files) should go in their respective folders.

Please be sure to edit your website and other information in MOTD.ini before starting v1.3 server.
Your server information should show up on the server list, but if your MOTD.ini is not correct
then there will be no link to your website, You will not be listed as the server owner, and the
other various features from the list will not be supported correctly until the file is edited and the server is 
restarted.

To view the current serverlist (servers that are running v1.3 will show up) visit :

Thank You, and have fun with 1.3.

P.S.
   For those of you that are testing v1.3 server for me, please report all bugs to kael@playerworlds.com.
