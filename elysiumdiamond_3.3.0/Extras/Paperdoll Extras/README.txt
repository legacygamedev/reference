---Installing paperdoll---

You will see two files in here: Paperdoll_Items.bmp and Paperdoll_Sprites.bmp.

They're both used with Paperdoll. However, they will only be used if you have 
paperdoll turned on for your game. If you want paperdoll on, you need to change 
Paperdoll=0 in the Data.ini (located in server folder) to Paperdoll=1. Simply 
restart the server (if it wasn't off in the first place) and rename the 
Paperdoll_Items.bmp to Items.bmp and Paperdoll_Sprites.bmp to Sprites.bmp then 
paste them both in your GFX folder (located in the Client folder). Now you will 
be using paperdoll! ENJOY!


--Help with paperdoll---

Paperdoll is simple to use, really. In the item editor, make a new equipment 
item (weapon, armor, shield, and so on), then when choosing the item you want 
to use, you'll notice a single image of the item with a row of items below it. 
The row of items is what will be used to appear over your character. Choose 
the single item that's by itself and when the player equips that item he'll 
see the corresponding items in the row below the item you picked. Then simply 
set what other item requirements and bonuses you want it to have and then 
click Ok and you're done! Test it out yourself by putting the item on the map, 
pick it up, and double click it! You should see it appear over your character!
