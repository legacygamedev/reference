|::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::|
 --------------------------------------------------
This feature list is updated with everything that is
ever added to konfuze. This includes every tiney thing
added since the blank MS was taken. Newest addition
is shown first.

|:::::::::::::::::::::Version 1::::::::::::::::::::|
|::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::|
 --------------------------------------------------
This is the very first version of Konfuze Classic,
remember there are many things to come but remember
even the original Konfuze had to start somewhere :)

----------------------------------------------------
Bugs fixed this version:
----------------------------------------------------
- Early beta tests with cronius showed some vital flaws
  in the character creation, after some wrestling with
  the code these are now re-written and work properly :)

- Again thanks to dragoons master, it now picks up the
  top item on the ground, as before it would pick up
  the bottom one. Annoying, but was an incredibly easy
  fix ^_^

- During the course of me adding things i somehow
  managed to break the chat system.. after a few hours
  of work its fixed, pffft friggin thing lol!

- The bandestroy command is now fixed, it now actually
  wipes the banlist instead of doing.. well not much
  really :)

- Players now save individually and only if they are
  online, previously everything saved reguardless and
  it lagged a wee bit. Thanks to Dragoons_Master for
  showing me how to update my code ^_^

- Shield strength requirement now works :)

- Fixed the 'spell cast' bug, pretty annoying thing as
  when you cast a spell if you had an item equipped it
  would say "you hit blah for 10 with dagger" or w/e.
  Now thats fixed, and it simply says "you cast on blah
  for 10 hitpoints." or something along those lines ^_^

- Fixed the 'npc targeting' bug. Previously if an npc
  or player was on top of an item you couldnt target
  them, now you can :)

- Fixed the most annoying MS thing ever, the 'position
  modification' bug. Basically its where you go to move
  and the server says you tried to hack and kicks you.
  doesent anymore :>

- Fixed the 'NPC's dont move' bug.

- Fixed 'item req x2' bug.

-----------------------------------------------------
Features added this version:
-----------------------------------------------------
- Took me over an hour but all the forms are now
  neat and pretty, sound stupid but it made a huge
  difference to the feel of the engine from an admin's
  point of view.

- 'whos online' added client side. Press F3 to bring
  it up. And of course, it has custom GUI.

- You can now test the music in the map properties.

- Music now loops and if you go to a map that is using
  the same music it does not reset.

- Max_Map_Npc's is now 10

- Music loops and if you move to a map with the same
  music it does not reset. yey.

- NPC's names are now above their heads :)

- Have removed the whole 'run' thing, and simply made
  the walking faster and smoother. NPC's are still the
  old speed however.

- The npceditor was cleaned up, all the useless stuff
  has been removed. Also the npc health and experience
  is now customisable :)

- While trying something new i realised the friendly
  npc's didnt say anything to you if you hit them, they
  do now ^_^

- Ok, -puts on ear muffs-, you can all cheer now; i have
  completely removed item durability! -eardrums explode
  from everyones cheering-. I was unsure about a few
  things and i had some bugs but once again thanks to
  dragoons master who helped me out its working. xd

- Removed the fix item system, its the first stage in
  removing item durability completely.

- Spells is now also in its own window, however use F2
  to bring it up :), and yes it does have a custom GUI
  ^_^

- Inventory is now in its own window, you can bring it
  up by pressing F1 - as usual it has a custom GUI.

- Ingame font made neat, now has a 1px border around it
  rather than the ewwy shadow :)

- Changed the chat box format from "says 'blah' to you"
  to ": blah".

- If the interface files cannot be found it will now
  just give a blank white interface.

- The ingame screen has no gui as such, however the
  small GUI underneath the screen now has a template
  and is customisable. I cannot stress enough how the
  GUI templates are not meant to be used, they are
  just guidelines!

- In the new character window where you choose your
  class, dont you think it would be a bit stupid if
  you wanted people to be able to select different
  races but above the race menu it had "class:". Well
  i dont want to leave any details out however minor
  so you can edit the label above the drop down menu
  via the configuration.ini to whatever you want. :)

- Completely integrated the male/female system, and
  also added 'show sprite at character create' which
  to my suprise i managed to get to work perfectly
  along side the male/female system. Yey for my
  education ^_^

- male/female system added using the traditional
  config.ini malesprite/femalesprite options.

- Added customisable interface. You can use either
  .gif, .jpg or .png files for your games unique
  user interface. The client will come with a
  template for each different window to get you
  started!

- You must now specify the game name and website
  server side also, as the game name is used to give
  your server a more personal feel and it looks alot
  more proffessional handing a server with your games
  name on it over to a hoster.

- The game name and game website is now able to be
  set via the client side configuration.ini. The
  advantage of this is the gamename will appear as
  the caption for the main window, and also if the
  server is offline it will prompt you that the
  'gamename' server is offline and to visit whatever
  website is specified.
  -------
  UPDATE: Game name now = ingame window header.
  -------

- The message of the day is also now specified via
  the server side Configuration.ini.

- IP and port is now specified via the client config
  file located in the core files folder. Remember if
  you change the port you must also change the server
  port! Do this via the server configuration.ini file
  located in the server core files folder.

- The credits page is now customisable by you, simply
  edit the Configuration.ini in the core files folder
  and add your own credits! Special thanks to Steve for
  teaching me how to read/write from .ini files. Its super
  easy but one of those things i never really learnt. ty!

- Added client side /shutdown command for admins.
  Very usefull, if somethings going wrong and you dont
  (for some reason) have access to the server, you
  can now shut it down by yourself!

- Improved the server shutdown, now counts down in
  seconds and you can cancel the shutdown by going
  "File > Cancel Shutdown" in the server.

- Optimised server system tray, now when minimised
  it uses less memory than before - also now you
  must left click on the system tray icon to be
  prompted with several options. Much cleaner and
  more stable.

- Transparent color set for Tiles items and sprites
  via the color of the first row in that .bmp file.
